# Natural-Language-Processing-and-Topic-Modeling-on-Product-Review

The purpose of this project was to cluster customer reviews of watch products into groups and uncover latent semantic structures using Python programming.

In this project, I use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

### Project Overview:

Step 1: Load Data

Step 2: Data preprocessing 

        Tokenization, stemming, removing stop words
        
Step 3: TF-IDF

        Extracted features by Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency
        
Step 4: Model Training 

        Trained unsupervised machine learning models(K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Analysis) 
        
Step 5: Result Visualization

        Identified latent topics and keywords for each cluster, visualized model training results using 2D and 4D graphs (WordCloud, 4D Scatterplot) 


### Result:

### Business Recommendation:
1. The watch is good product, many customers like it!
2. LDA cross-validation: Some customers are couples, we can deliver targeted advertising on Valentine's Day
3. Constructive instruction: Some customers feel disappointed, the quality of this watch product need to improve after a long-term use, we can provide after-purchase service to improve customer satisfaction
