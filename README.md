# Natural-Language-Processing-and-Topic-Modeling-on-Product-Review
This is an unsupervised learning project about analyzing customer product reviews

In this project, I use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

### Business Recommendation:
1. The watch is good product, many customers like it!
2. LDA cross-validation: Some custoemrs are couples, we can deliver targeted advertising on Valentine's Day
3. Constructive instruction: Some customers feel disappointed, the quality of this watch product need to improve after a long-term use, we can provide after-purchase service to improve customer satisfaction
